<!-- Week 9 Report -->

<!--
    1. What did I do since the last meeting?
        -After working on the team activity I had to go home and go through the teacher's
         solution so that it would make more sense for me.
    2. What am I going to do next?
        -I need to keep reading and trying to understand the functions of JavaScript because
        this exercise really threw me for a loop.
    3. What are my blockers?
        -For some reason my brain gets really overwhelmed any time I 
         look at JavaScript so that is my biggest blocker.
